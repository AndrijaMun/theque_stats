# theque_stats
 
A simple app that generates mostly randomised, fictional traffic data for The Que (an ice cream shop) and performs some simple analysis on it.

A quickly put together WIP with lots of progress to be made in terms of best practices (in terms of performance, readability and usage). Mainly created to demonstrate basic knowledge of Python & SQL.
