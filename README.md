# theque_stats
 
A simple app that generates mostly randomised, fictional traffic data for The Que (an ice cream shop) and performs some simple analysis on it.

The data is somewhat realistic, factoring in things like the opening and closing hours, maximum weekly hours and free days for employees, multiple types of coupons that affect the payment process, etc.

A quickly put together WIP with lots of progress to be made in terms of best practices (performance, readability and usage). Mainly created to demonstrate basic knowledge of Python & SQL.
